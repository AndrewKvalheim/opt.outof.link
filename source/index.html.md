I've chosen to opt out of LinkedIn™ by joining its [Do Not Contact][] list.

This means that messages to me via LinkedIn™ won't go through---even if it looks
like they did. Please use a different method of communication, such as phone or
email.

If you'd like to learn about my professional history or review my references,
please let me know and I'll be happy to provide them.

Thank you, and have a wonderful day!
